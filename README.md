<img align="right" src="img/EarDrumLogo_v1.jpg" width="200" />

EAR Drummer is a realtime interactive music system that generates rhythmical drum patterns.\
It produces midi output that provides backing music to accompany a Jazz soloist.\
It uses **E**volutionary Computing, is fully **A**utonomous and **R**eacts to midi input.

## Quick Start

EAR Drummer is implemented in pure Java.\
The easiest way of running it is by executing the released Jar.\
If you want to compile the project's source, it is recommended to use the Ant build file.\
An short instruction to the GUI can be found in the *doc/* directory.

## Future Plans:

* Transformation of *RuleBased* Approach to *CombinationBased*\
(see src/init/Settings.java -> FitnessVersion.CombinationBased)\
Rules become different combinations of SoloFactors and PatternFactors
